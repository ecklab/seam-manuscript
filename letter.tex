Dear Editor: 

We are submitting our manuscript ``SEAM methodology for context-rich player matchup evaluations in baseball'' for your consideration at the American Statistician. This manuscript is at the interface between statistical methodology and a current baseball industry problem involving the estimation and prediction of batted-ball locations. 

In this manuscript we develop the SEAM method as a technique for estimating the batted-ball distribution for a matchup involving a specific batter and pitcher. Our method overcomes the challenge of sparse matchup data by pooling batted-ball locations of other players that are weighted by similarity. Mathematical justification for this method is provided. A detailed validation study reveals that our SEAM approach more accurately predicts the locations of batted-ball locations than existing publicly available methods.

Included with this submission is a Shiny web application \url{https://deck13.shinyapps.io/seam/} that implements and provides visualizations of our SEAM methodology. This web application is fast, providing users with visual measures of batter-pitcher matchups nearly instantaneously.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere, and it is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Julia Wapner \\
David Dalpiaz \\
Daniel J. Eck
