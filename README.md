# SEAM manuscript (version 2.0)

This version of the manuscript corresponds to the second version of the SEAM shiny application: https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/app/ which is hosted here: https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/index.html

We are in the process of adding validation results and balls-in-play batting metrics which are expectations of batting outcomes taken with respect to the full SEAM distribution.

Changes from version 1 include: bug fixes, improved computational speed, improved visualizations, and the inclusion of stadium visuals for which the computed spray charts overlay.
